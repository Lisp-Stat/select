Select is a facility for selecting portions of sequences, arrays or data-frames. It provides:

An API for taking slices (elements selected by the Cartesian product of vectors of subscripts for each axis) of array-like objects.  The most important function is `select`. Unless you want to define additional methods for `select`, this is pretty much all you need from this library.  See the documentation at https://lisp-stat.github.io/select/ for a tutorial.

An extensible DSL for selecting a subset of valid subscripts. This is useful if, for example, you want to resolve column names in a data frame in your implementation of slice.

A set of utility functions for traversing slices in array-like objects.
